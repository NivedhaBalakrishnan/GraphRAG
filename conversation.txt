infection.

prolonged, persistent response that can be protective or
pathogenic depending on the circumstances.

user: tell me about acute inflammation
bot: Inflammation can be beneficial as a self-limiting, healing
process, but persistent inflammation can have both
protective and pathogenic effects. Chronic inflammation can
affect hematopoiesis and B lymphopoiesis by diverting
lymphoid progenitors from the B lineage, inducing apoptosis
in developing B cells, and mobilizing developing B cells to
the periphery. Additionally, inflammation can alter
hematopoietic output by favoring myelopoiesis over
lymphopoiesis.
